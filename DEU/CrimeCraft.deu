Caption_Rules=Suggestions for Gaining Reputation
Caption_Rules_Text=Combat - If you are in the Top 50 for the PvP Monthly Ladder or Top 500 for the PvP Life Ladder you will receive additional Reputation every day.\nProgress - Through the Bleedout Campaign you will receive Reputation from the missions and corresponding achievements. This is a great way to efficiently level and gain Reputation.\nLeadership - Maintaining the position of Gang Leader is the best way to gain Reputation in this category.\nGame time - Logging in at least once each day is the easiest way to gain Reputation. Completing multiple achievements or jobs in a 24 hour period is a tough task but rewards players with a high amount of Reputation.\nWealth - Obtaining and spending Gold Bars quickly helps rack up Reputation in this category. Owning property and decking it out will give players a constant stream of reputation each day.\nSpecial Achievement - It is extremely rare and difficult to gain Reputation in this category. Participating and winning community or special in-game events are your best bet.
Caption_Medal_Text=Medals are awarded at various milestones within each of the six Reputation Categories. These Reputation Medals are displayed in the Player's signature and represent their achievements to date. Players must gain the required Reputation for a given category and rank to unlock the Medal.

[ClubCampaign]
JensPulver=Hey, what's up? Looking to hide out for a bit, get out of the crossfire for a few easy minutes, huh? Well, I can escort you there, no sweat. Hideouts are a great place to store your shit, craft stuff in safety, and basically call your own private castle. And if you haven't done it yet, you should talk to your Secretary about purchasing a private night club. That's the BEST way to kick back... Look for her inside, she'll help you set everything up. So are you ready to go now or what?
JensPulver1=Party's hopping inside - you want in?
Secretary1=Hi, sweetie. Say hello to your new Hideout, where you and your gang members can duck out of sight for a spell. The place is pretty basic now, but just let me know if you'd like to add anything to the joint - vendors, storage, etc - and I'll do my best to line it up for you.\n\nGo ahead and make yourself comfortable, and if there's anything I can do for you, just let me know.
Secretary2=Are you ready to spruce up the place? Maybe add a nightclub or something? A Club is a great place to host social events with other people - you know, throw private parties for your gang, or even host an open party that anyone can attend. Only the Gang Leader can purchase a Club, so talk to me when you're up for it and I'll show you the menu.
Secretary3=Your club is being set up right now. If you want to hire a few vendors for inside the club - you know, to sell stuff you or your guests might want to buy - let me know and I can set them up for you.\n\nIf you wanna check out your club for yourself, go talk to the Club Porter by the door. He'll take you there. Once inside, find your manager, she can help you customize the club to your own personal specifications.
ClubPorter1=Evening, boss. The place is pretty quiet back there right now. You should go inside and talk to your Club Manager, make sure she's setting things up how you want'em.\n\nYou wanna head inside and see for yourself?
ClubPorter2=Wanna check out the Club?
ClubPorter3=Had enough loud music, huh?  Where do you wanna go?
Manager1=Hey, good looking. What do you think? Pretty good space, good accoustics, 3 foot thick concrete walls... you could survive an atomic blast in here and enjoy the next 20 years of fallout in comfort and style... \n\nMy name's Samantha, and I'll be your Club Manager.  I... \n...what? What's that look on your face? Something here not meet your taste? Cuz I can change it up if you want, I got all kinds of styles and options to choose from.\n\nWhy don't you take a look around, then come back and tell me what you wanna modify.
Manager2=Okay, let me show you some of the options for the place. We can modify pretty much everything in here but the core structure - wallpaper, floors, furniture, lighting, lasers, dance stages, you name it.\n\nIn order to modify something, just select the category icon and your options will appear on the right.  Select the one you'd like, then press Preview to see it in action. This is only temporary, so if you want to keep it, you'll have to re-open the modification menu (Tab Key) to buy it.
Manager3=There are four different areas to modify:\n\nThe CLUB SETTING affect this room and the floor below.\n\nThe VIP settings allow you to modify what goes on in the VIP room downstairs... That's your super-special private spot, so go wild...\n\nThe FURNITURE settings allow you to buy and arrange items around the club.\n\nDANCERS are just what you think: lovely ladies just waiting to wiggle for your enjoyment. Make sure you've got a place for them to dance, first.
Manager4=Got all that? Here - check out the menu. If you need me to explain something, press the 'Help' button (question mark), and then point at something you don't understand.\n\nReady?
Manager5=You haven't purchased any modifications yet... you can't possibly be satisfied with the place how it is now...\n\nWanna see the modification menu?
Manager6=You haven't purchased any furniture yet. This place is like a roller-skating rink! Think about your guests' comfort... and where your dancers will do their thing...\n\nIf you need help selecting or arranging furniture, check out the help (question mark) button then point at the different parts of the menu.\n\nWanna check out your furniture options now?
Manager7=I know I'm hot, but you really should hire some dancers if you want worthwhile eye-candy.\n\nCheck out the DANCERS tab in the modifications menu. Show me what you want, and I'll be sure to get that girl on floor for you right away.\n\nDo you want to look at the lineup of dancers now?
Manager8=Whats the point in owning a club if you're not gonna throw any parties? You should announce this new spot to the world!\n\nThere are two types of parties you can throw:  a private party for you and your crew, or a public party that anyone can attend... assuming they can afford whatever cover charge you decide to ask at the door... Yeah, thats cash money that you get to keep!\n\nWhenever you want to throw a party, just let me know, and I'll spread the word. You can start by pressing the Party icon at the top of the menu bar.\n\nShould I set something up now?
Customization1=Hi, good looking. Nice party! Unfortunately I can't mod the place while a Party is going on, so let me know if you want to shut it down and I'll get the bouncers moving.
Bartender1=Whassup, boss? Pretty nice place, this should be pretty hot pretty soon. You know, if you really wanna make this place functional, you should hire some vendors in case you wanna handle some business while staring at a pair of tits.\n\nTalk to Secretary, she's in the Hideot, for those kinds of hires. She'll hook this place up.

Caption_GangHideout=Gang Hideout
Caption_Club=Club
Description_DouglasAvenueLabs=This facility was deliberately left between the Inner-and Outer-walls due to the dangerous substances used in the manufacturing of psychotropic and biological substances.  It still offers valuable research and testing tools.
Description_OldSunriseCityHall=The original campus of civil government.  It was one of the first targets of riot during the Bleedout, and was thus abandoned completely, intentionally left outside the constructed security walls.  Many believe it still contains valuable secrets ...  
Description_Downtown=One of the larger commercial/retail districts in Sunrise City, and the most wealthy of the Civil Defense Districts, where the seediest interests can be pursued.  It is the preferred hangout for THE RYUJIN, BRATVA, and THE DISCIPLINE.
Description_MisukiTower=Built by Misuki Motors, this tower was claimed by Oyabun Oyanagi of the Ryujin Dragon Kings after the Bleedout destroyed the auto industry.  Despite the ruin and damage gathered during the riots, the structure remains a frequented location for corporate espionage.
Description_Delosville=TThis sporting arena lies outside in what is some consider Rogue territory.  Although it is frequently populated by Rogues and Squatters, many citizens and criminals use this large, commune-like 'mini-city' for business and rendezvous.
Description_BellyStreet=This depressed neighborhood is one of the poorest within the walls, but manages to stay that way despite the Mayor's best efforts to rehabilitate that district.  After all, a depressed neighborhood makes a good marketplace for narcotics...
Description_OthelloSkyBridge=One of the city's more famous architectural structures before the Bleedout.  It connected two of the tallest structures in the city, and is one of the few remaining signature landmarks still visible on Sunrise City's horizon line.
Description_SouthCanalSpillways=One of the oldest sections of the City, it is now in perpetual dispute from numerous gangs and Rogue tribes.
Description_LXMPortComplex=This dockside facility was once managed by the mega-industrial corporation, LXM Shipping, but is now used almost exclusively by the Trenchton Trading Company.  It is considered a source of unexplored wealth, as there are several thousand shipping containers which remain unopened.
Description_ReinholdMuseum=Although gutted by looters, the Reinhold Museum still stands as little more than a criminal storehouse and a convenient 'above-ground tunnel' plagued by Rogue squatters.
Description_SunriseHarbor=This city-owned storage complex had once been a tourist spot with small theme restaurants and shops, but has since been converted almost completely into a shipping and receiving station.  It remains a key location because of its role in keeping the city supplied. 
Description_CenterStreetStation=While technically located outside the walls, this area is still frequented by intrepid smugglers looking to bypass the security screening entrances.  This heavily fortified location is under perpetual dispute.
Description_IsopachOil=Constructed by the Isopatch Oil company mere months before the Bleedout occurred, it was intended to be one of the first 'green drilling rigs' in the world.  Unfortunately the Bleedout event led to its abandonment, and it has since been claimed by various independent research groups.
Description_RefugeeArea=This is entry Point 7 of the 9 secure entry points along the walls surrounding the city.  It is the most inaccessible Entry Point along the outer walls, surrounded by The Marsh, but that still doesn't stop refugees from working their way here.
Description_ChemtechProcessingPlant=This processing facility was formerly run by the megaindustrial, ChemTech, and is now a perpetual staging ground for raids and research.  It is believed that many Chemtech secrets are still hidden inside from before The Bleedout, making it a target for treasure-hunters of all kinds.
Description_Midtown=This is the heart of Sunrise City, the seat of Municipal government and the heart of the business district.  Landmarks include the new, makeshift City Hall.  It is primarily populated by THE MUNICIPALITY and LA FAMIGLIA BIANCHI (LA COSA NUOVO).
Description_DeckardHardor=The lowest level of Deckard Plaza had once been an open, thriving port district, but has since become a dense, desperate slum  thriving in the shadows of the more affluent buildings that tower overhead.
Description_MunicipalityBank=This is just one of many warehouse districts used by the Municipality and Scorpion Chamber to store stockpiles of resources.  It regularly comes under Feds attack and the defense of the facility often falls to the gangs that inhabit the city.
Description_Oceanside=Oceanside was one of Sunrise City's nicer districts, kept presentable as the basis for tourism.  It is now a heavily patrolled waterside port, primarily frequented by the TRENCHTON TRADING COMPANY and THE SONS OF LIBERTY.
Description_McKenzie'sSportCenter=Named after the homegrown football legend, Avery MacKenzie, the Sports Center facilities were home to numerous sporting events before the Bleedout ruined the city's bid for the Olympic Games.
Description_MunicipalityWarehouse&Storage=This is just one of many warehouse districts used by the Municipality and Scorpion Chamber to store stockpiles of resources.  It regularly comes under Rogue attack and the defense of the facility often falls to the gangs that inhabit the city. 
Description_OlympiaMills(WEST)=Despite advances in technology, this old-fashioned industrial mill is populated by Rogues and squatters who have managed to infiltrate the outer walls.  Many believe the area to be rampant with contagious disease brought in by the unwashed outsiders.
Description_MaxymAlley=The back alley behind Club Maxym Red is notorious for its private gladiator matches.  It is small, with few places to hide, which makes it extremely dangerous.

The list shows gangs that have five or more members online that are eligible to fight in a Gang Battle. Once selected, the rival gang leader has 1 minute  to accept the offer or it will be cancelled automatically.\n  Once the rival gang leader accepts the battle, the Gang Battles management window opens and both gang leaders choose from their online gang members to build their five-man team.\n  On the same screen, each gang leader selects a game mode and map for the battle. If the gang leaders choose different maps and modes, one of the two will be randomly selected when the match begins.\n  In the same window gang leaders can wager in-game cash from the gang's bank on the match.\n  After all options are selected by both gang leaders, they confirm their choices and the match begins. Once the match is over, the wagered money is automatically deposited in the winner's gang bank.\n <c=f3ce00><f=0>\nAccepting or Creating an Open Offer<c=ffffff><f=1>\n \n  In addition to a direct challenge, gangs can create open offers that are listed on the Rumble List tab. To join an open offer, go to the Gang Battles Manager and form a team of five gang members, then select the offer you want to join from the Rumble List.\n  To create an Open Offer, the gang leader should go to the Gang Battles Manager and click on Create Offer.\n  In the Gang Manager window, the leader chooses up to five online gang members to play in the match. The gang leader can choose to play or pick five gang members do his dirty work for him. Then, in the new pop-up window, the gang leader chooses the game type, map, money bid on the game and what a rival gang would need to bid to accept and the number of times the offer will be Reused after a match is completed.\n  Once all parameters are set, the gang leader accepts the offer and it is posted on the Rumble List. The match automatically begins once any rival gang accepts the offer. If the Reuse parameter is set to greater than one, the offer will re-post on the Rumble List when the match is over until the number of Gang Battles played equals the Reuse number.
